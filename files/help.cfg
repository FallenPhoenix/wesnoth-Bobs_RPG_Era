<span size='small'>- There are four character classes: Warrior, Ranger, Vagabond, Magician.
- Your initial choice of class determines certain stats like hitpoints, moves and max xp.
- Within each class there are five levels: Layman, Novice, Experienced, Veteran, Master.
- You begin as Experienced in your primary class, and a Layman in all others (except for Mixed Class units, which begin as Novices in two classes).
- Despite this initial choice, a character can progress, at a cost, in other classes.
- You gain 10 character points every time your unit AMLAs. These can be used to improve your character or advance a class level.
- Advancing class doesn't affect stats in any way, it simply allows a new set of options.
- For any character to boost melee/ranged damage they must advance in Warrior/Ranger class level.</span>"

- Certain items in the inventory have one use (click on a potion, for instance, and you drink it).
- Characters can only use different weapons if they have the relevant weapon skill (for example, bowmanship allows you to use various types of bows).
- Click on your current weapon at the top of your inventory to equip a new weapon.
- You can also give items and gold to another player by right-clicking on them when you are in an adjacent hex.
- When a character dies, all their stuff gets dumped on the ground allowing other players to pick it up.
- However, items and weapons in use at the time of death are assumed to be either destroyed or stolen (or perhaps buried in a ritualistic fashion with the corpse).</span>"

- The chance of scoring a critical hit is determined by the unit level of the attacker, but it can be boosted with character points and items.
- A character's critical hit chance is displayed in the character sheet, along with their weapon skills.
- When an attacker gets lucky the target will suffer a random critical hit. A unit cannot have the same critical hit twice.
- There are four types of critical hits: maimed (-1 strike), blinded (-10% chance to hit), crippled (-2 movement), brained (-1xp per turn).
- A critical hit is healed when the unit starts a new turn with full health.</span>"
